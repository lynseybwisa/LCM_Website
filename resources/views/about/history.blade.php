<p>In 1921 the Loreto Pioneers Mother Francis Borgia who started Loreto in Kenya and Mother Raphael Gordon built up Msongari.  The building in which Msongari first functioned as a school still exists today.  It consists of the two school offices, the two parlous (now Loreto Education Secretary Office) and the two classrooms.  They are the oldest stone building built in the Highlands of Kenya.  In this simple building 17 pupils began on 11th of November, 1921. 

<hr>
 The first arrival that morning was Eva Blowers.  She was wearing a navy tunic and a white blouse.  This became the Msongari uniform.  The pupils also decided on the choice of red for the blazer and jumper.  In this way the characteristic RED of Loreto Schools in Kenya was introduced.  Msongari grew with new additions being added.  In 1929 the tennis courts and the concert hall were built.  This was the first school hall in Kenya.
 
 <hr>

Then in 1936 the second storey was added to the quadrangle.  This was designed by Mother Gordon who was the superior at Msongari at that time.  The years that followed were ones of continuous growth in buildings, and in the number of pupils, but then the Second World War started and this changed the pattern of growth in an unexpected way.</p>

<p>The years that followed were ones of continuous growth in buildings, and in the number of pupils, but then the Second World War started and this changed the pattern of growth in an unexpected way.  The British army informed Mother Raphael Gordon that it was likely that the buildings of Msongari would be needed for the FANEYS (i.e. the women army) and that Msongari would have to prepare to be evacuated.  Mother Raphael spent the next year looking at possible sites, and eventually decided on the estates of German count in LUMBWA (now Kipkellion) on the way to Kisumu.  In 1940 the entire school moved up to the hills of Lumbwa leaving behind only those Nairobi children whose parents felt they were too young to go far away.  Some nuns remained behind to run a small day school at Valley Road.  The intention was to close to it after the war ended, and Msongari was re-opened.  But this never happened, and Valley Road grew into its present size.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In May 1946 the Great Trek back to Nairobi took place.  Of all the children who had known Msongari before coming to Lumbwa, only one remained who could speak of ‘Msongari – Lumbwa – Msongari’.  Some of the Msongari Valley Road Children returned to Msongari but most continued in Valley Road.  The biggest change that the girls noticed on their return from Lumbwa, was a new boy’s school in small and unpretentious buildings that once had been coffee sheds on the sides of St. Austin’s church.  This was St. Mary’s School.  Loreto Msongari continued to grow.  

<hr>

In 2003 the school introduced the British Curriculum – G.C.E. and was approved as a Centre in 2005.  It then changed to I.G.C.S.E. in 2007 after G.C.E. was phased out.   In 2013 the school introduced a boarding section for students who wish to board, the numbers of which have steadily grown to over 250 students.  The school provided quality education, offering 8-4-4 and British curriculum of education.  We strive to form an all round person.</p>
