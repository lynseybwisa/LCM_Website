      The Foundress of the Loreto Sisters – Mary Ward, goes down in history as a great woman of many firsts! She lived over 400 yrs ago – born and bred in England. Her dream was to empower the women of the world through formal education in order to become equal and respected partners in society. She believed that education was the fire missing in the lives of the women and she did all she could to make it happen. Looking at it today, our society has had a lot in common with Mary Ward’s society. </p>
      <p>
      I have often asked myself how we made the champions? And the answer lies in the holistic education that we offer; an education that endeavours to mould the intellect, the physical, emotional, spiritual and social aspect of our girls. Nothing can replace this approach to education because once any of these dimensions is ignored there is a vacuum in the end product. This is our joy and this is our success story.</p>
      <p>
      We recognize the gift of each child and encourage them to become their best in their talents and giftedness – there is none without talent. Some are able to shine in a number of activities and we celebrate them, they become all-round but there are those who may not be good in all areas but do well in one or two activities.</p>

      ‘…education for the girls, excellency for the world, Mary Ward had a dream that brought the Loreto steam; And together they all fought , that all girls may be taught, In God’s grace and His hands Msongari will always stand …’</em>

      <p>
      Today we do not have to ‘fight so that our girls may be taught’ but we must continue to encourage our girls to learn to become the best they can ever become. My heart goes out to the many girls who are not as lucky as our girls are, especially those who still find themselves trapped in retrogressive cultural practices that do not allow them to become what God intended of them. My prayer and firm commitment is that we give every girl what is their due respect and place in society, I dream of a society where the dream of Mary Ward, that all girls maybe taught is fulfilled. I believe in God that women in time to come will do much. And I know with the help of Venerable Mary Ward that my dream is also valid!
